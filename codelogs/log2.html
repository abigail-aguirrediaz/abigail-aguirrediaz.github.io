    <h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>

    <h2>Difference between absolute and relative CSS length units</h2>
    <p>To learn about the difference between absolute and relative CSS
        I read the article "CanIUse:<length>units" to define absolute CSS
            and relative CSS. According to this article, "The <length> CSS data type represents a
                distance value." Regarding relative lengths, they "are based on font, container,
                or viewport sizes".
                Some of these examples can be found in these CSS length units,
                cap: which in detail is "Equal to the "cap height" (nominal height of capital letters)
                of the element's font."
                ch:"Represents the width or, more precisely, the advance measure of the glyph
                0 (zero, the Unicode character U+0030) in the element's font.
                In cases where determining the measure of the 0 glyph is impossible
                or impractical, it must be assumed to be 0.5em wide by 1em tall."
                ex: "Equal to the x-height of the element's font. In fonts with the x letter,
                this is generally the height of lowercase letters in the font; 1ex ≈ 0.5em in many fonts."
                Now that we have an idea what relative CSS is, what is absolute CSS?
                The article describes absolute CSS, "represent a physical measurement when the physical properties of
                the output medium are known, such as for print layout. This is done by anchoring one
                of the units to a physical unit or the visual angle unit and then defining the others relative to it".
                According to the article "CSS Units", some examples for absolute lengths would be "cm, mm, in",but we
                must stay aware of screen sizes."
                Overall, to summarize absolute units remain fixed while relative units adjust dynamically.
