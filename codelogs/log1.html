    <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>

    <p> What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</p>

    <p>To begin answering this question, we must first know what semantic tags mean.
        According to the article "Semantic HTML", semantic means "relating to meaning".
        When we apply this in HTML, this would mean that we are basing the strucutre of HTML on it's meaning,
        not appearance.</p>
    <p> When we use a non semantic elements it's harder for us to know what it's representing.
        Basically semantic elements allow us to know the purpose and or meaning of the code we are trying
        to achieve without using the HTML tag.</p>
    <p>Below we can find the example's the article provided to see non-semantic tags vs semantic tags in code.
        As we wil see, the first code has no semantic value making it more complicated to understand VS the semantic
        code.</p>
<textarea>
    The non semantic tag in this example is <div> and <span>
    <div>
  <span>Three words</span>
  <div>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <div>five words</div>
</textarea>


<textarea>
    Code example with semantic Tags
    <header>
  <h1>Three words</h1>
  <nav>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
  </nav>
</header>
<main>
  <header>
    <h2>five words</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <h2>three words</h2>
    <p>forty-six words</p>
</textarea>


    <p>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</p>

    <p>Now that we know what semantics in HTML are, we can see how it can have many benefits in coding.
        According to the article "A Detailed Guide on HTML Semantics", there are multiple benefits including
        structure, accessibility, compatibility, etc.</p>
    <p>One of those benefits is accessibility.Semantic HTML allows those with disabilities to have a
        friendlier user experience, as well as a clear strucutre.</p>
    <p>A second benefit would be browser compatibility. With new tehcnologies, semantic elements allow
        for adaptability with future technology.</p>
